# Piscine February 2020 - 42Lisbon

Those are the exercises I did for the Piscine (december 2020), unchanged and unedited.  
All of them exept BSQ passed the tests, still some of them were not perfect and didn't got 100% score.  
Some of them were resubmitted multiple times and maybe the last few modifications are not included in those versions.  
Please be kind and cautious when looking into that code, it was one of my first serious coding experiences.  
  
Most of this code could have been written in a better way ðŸ˜„

## If you are doing the Piscine or planning to do it

Be good with yourself and do not look into this code before you solved the subjects yourself.  
If you look at somebody else solution before to find your own you are missing the best part of the learning process.  
Try instead to speak with others having the same issue and solve it in a collaborative way.  
  
(Of course, good luck and have fun ;))
